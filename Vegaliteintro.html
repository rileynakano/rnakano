    <h2>Visualization 1: Global Sales by Genre and Platform</h2>
        <p class="boldbody">What trends do you notice? What’s interesting 
    in the data? Are there certain platforms or genres that dominate the sales? </p>
    <p><span class="boldbody">Reflection:</span> <br> The main thing I noticed is that due to when the data 
    set was made, the newer consoles (3DS, Xbox One, and PS4) generally have
    fewer sales than their predecessors. I also noticed that Wii Sports has
    a lot of sales, dwarfing other sports games, especially since no other 
    sports game on other consoles came close. </p>

        <p><span class="boldbody">Design Decisions:</span> <br> I chose to go with a marked 
    circle, with the circle size representing how many sales a game had. 
    This visualization works because each combination of genre and platform 
    is easily visible in the graphic while providing a general idea of how much
    a genre-platform pair does with audiences. The X axis being the platform
    is better because all the names are shortened, so they are easier to read
    than the genre names that are made up of full words.</p>

    <h3>Question 1.1: What genre has the highest sales from nintendo platforms?</h3>
        <p><span class="boldbody">Design Decisions:</span> <br> I chose to go with
    a mark circle graph again, with circle size representing how many
    sales a game had. This visualization works because each combination
    of genre and platform is easily visible in the graphic while 
    providing a general idea of how much a genre-platform pair does
    with audiences. With fewer consoles, fewer circles make it 
    easier to read than the original visualization.</p>

    <div id="view1a"></div>

    <div>
    <h3>Question 1.2: Which platform has the most action games in its catalog</h3>

        <p><span class="boldbody">Design Decisions:</span> <br> I could have made
    a chart with the count of records and the console as the x and y 
    axes; however, I think this is actually better because the viewer
    actually has to look around less to see the whole chart, and with
    the sizes varying so much, comparing between consoles is actually
    pretty easy.</p>

    <h2>Visualization 2:  Sales Over Time by Platform and Genre</h2>
        <p class="boldbody">How have video game sales changed for different 
    platforms, genres, and publishers?</p><p><span class="boldbody">Reflection:</span> 
    <br> The spread of popularairty has stayed relatively consistent; however, 
    it can easily be seen when new consoles roll out due to the 
    quick color shift in the graph. Before 1990, games were heavily dominated
    by the Atari 2600 and the NES, respectively. When the years go on, we 
    see more competition when Xbox and PlayStation come in, while Nintendo
    is still producing home consoles like the Wii & Wii U, while dominating 
    the handheld console field with the DS and 3DS. With more consoles coming out, 
    the number of games sold has gone up as well, and we see a very consistent 
    incline in global sales until the dip in recent years, due to how recent
    the data is to the game releases. </p>

        <p><span class="boldbody">Design Decisions:</span> <br> The year and sales are the
    x and y axes, respectively; this gives the viewer an immediate idea of 
    how each game did and the performance over time. The platform was chosen
    to be color instead of genre because the platform lifespan will 
    automatically categorize over time, grouping each platform very easily.
    Each shape represents a genre. If I made the platform be represented 
    by a shape, there would be too many shapes to ever make out what is 
    what. With fewer categories in the genre, using different shapes works 
    much better.</p>

    <h3>Question 2.1: What were best selling games before the year 2000</h3>
        <p><span class="boldbody">Design Decisions:</span> <br> For this visualization 
    I tried to keep it the same as the visualization it originated from 
    so I could show the changes. Unfortunately, things like sales amount
    and console color have changed, but those connections wouldn’t remain 
    in the viewers' minds after they left the original anyway, so it is 
    okay to change.</p>

    <div id="view2a"></div>
    </div>

    <div>
    <h3>Question 2.2: What were the Wii games that sold between 5-10 million sales?</h3>
        <p><span class="boldbody">Design Decisions:</span> <br> The original y-axis 
    still had markers below 5 even though there was no data being presented
    there; I chose to just cut all of the markers so that it was easier 
    to read the data actually being presented.</p>

    <div id="view2b"></div>

    <h2>Visualization 3: Regional Sales vs. Platform</h2>
        <p class="boldbody">Do you notice any regional preferences or patterns? 
    Which platforms are more popular in specific regions?</p> 

        <p><span class="boldbody">Reflection:</span> <br>
    I mostly noticed how much other areas don’t purchase games since the other 
    regions' color is consistently at the bottom. Other than that, Europe 
    seems to heavily prefer PlayStation consoles and PCs, while North 
    Americans prefer the Xbox series as their console of choice. Old Nintendo 
    consoles such as the NES and SNES were very Japan-dominated, and once 
    the Wii came out, Nintendo started gaining a larger audience from other
    regions, especially North America. </p>

        <p><span class="boldbody">Design Decisions:</span> <br> The region being represented
    by color was a choice I made because with only 4 things that are being 
    measured and with a lot of possible overlapping, color allows the viewer
    to know exactly which region is being represented. The x-axis is the 
    platform stacked on top of this because it won’t scatter the plot at 
    all, so the only thing that a viewer might have to think about when 
    looking at this visualization is how many sales it had, which is okay 
    because that is what the y-axis of a graph is for.</p>

    <h3>Question 3.1: What were the best selling PC games in North America?</h3>
        <p><span class="boldbody">Design Decisions:</span> <br> I chose just to make 
        this visualization 1 line so viewers can read it easily.</p>

    <div id="view3a"></div>
    </div>

    <div>
    <h3>Question 3.2: What were the highest selling games per platform in Europe?</h3>
        <p><span class="boldbody">Design Decisions:</span> <br>  The y-axis is the 
    platform stacked on top of this because it won’t scatter the plot at 
    all, so the only thing that a viewer might have to think about when 
    looking at this visualization is how many sales it had, which is okay
    because that is what the x-axis of a graph is for.</p>

    <h2>Visualization 4: Visual Storytelling</h2>
        <p><span class="boldbody">Reflection:</span> <br> Looking at Nintendo consoles' 
    global sales over the years, I wanted to see how a specific company’s
    sales evolve with its games and consoles. I chose Nintendo for this 
    visualization (and some others) because Nintendo’s games are almost 
    solely locked to their own consoles. This allows me to worry less about
    any outside variables that could change how I see the visualization 
    while still getting as much accurate information as possible.</p>

        <p><span class="boldbody">Design Decisions:</span> <br> The platform being 
    colored is a choice I made previously. Since each platform is restricted 
    to a life span, if mixed with years, it automatically groups years 
    into larger categories.</p>

    <div id="view4"></div>
    </div>

    <div>
    <h3>Question 4.1: What were the highest selling NES games?</h3>
        <p><span class="boldbody">Design Decisions:</span> <br> The platform being 
    colored is a choice I made previously. Since each platform is restricted
    to a life span, if mixed with years, it automatically groups years 
    into larger categories.</p>

    <div id="view4a"></div>
    </div>

    <div>
    <h3>Question 4.2: Which year had the highest average sales?</h3>
        <p><span class="boldbody">Design Decisions:</span> <br> For this visualization I 
    wanted to show each region as a separate game was initially unexpected, 
    but I think it's more interesting to see how a game did regionally, since 
    the viewer can see how only one region carried a game’s success or how a
    game released in only one region outperformed one that was released in 
    multiple.</p>
